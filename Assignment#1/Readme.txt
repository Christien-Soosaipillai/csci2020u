What I did was basically crate the hash map to train the spam and ham maps. I was able to get all the maps to print however, when I am calculateing the final spam probability it keeps giving me the same probability value. I am getting different values even though I print and check them however it always gives me the same probability values. Also I am the only one working on this assignment.
